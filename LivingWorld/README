This was our final project in our C programming class. For this assignment, we had to create our actual world and build off of the framework in the previous assignment.
We had to create a world that would spawn creatures and food. The creatures had the ability to move around, eat food if any was found, and reproduce if it find another
creature. Multiple actions within the program rely on chance (by use of random numbers), meaning that there is probability behind spawning and reproducing. 
When the program is ran, 10 stages will run and output to the terminal. Within each stage, the creature will have a single action (move, eat, reproduce, or die). 
At the end of the simulation, there will be stats displaying how many creatures were spawned, the average hunger, age, and deaths that have occured. You can think of
each stage as one year in the world.
